Javascript Syntax Checker for BBEdit
=====================================

I used [John Gruber's PHP Syntax Checking script](http://daringfireball.net/2003/12/php_syntax_checking_in_bbedit)
as a model for this. You'll need to have [Javascript Lint command line tool](http://javascriptlint.com/)
installed. Copy and paste the code below into your favorite
AppleScript editor. Comments outline where you can customize it
to suit your own coding style.
